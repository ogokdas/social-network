By creating a Super User and utilizing the Django [(Admin Panel)](https://github.com/ogokdas/social-network/blob/main/png/admin.PNG), you can have control over the web application. I perform backend operations using the Django web framework in the Python language. The data is stored in an SQLite database. For the frontend, I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I achieve responsive design by utilizing Bootstrap templates.

Installation:

You can run the application on your local machine by following these steps:
1.	Clone the project's GitHub repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/ogokdas/social-network.git 
```
2.	Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd social-network-app
```
3.	Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):
```
python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate
```
4.	Install the required Python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
5.	Create the database:
```
python manage.py migrate 
```
6.	Start the development server:
```
